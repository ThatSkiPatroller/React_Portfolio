            Full stack web developer and graduate of The University of Texas at Austin with a bachelors in Biology, 
            a minor in French and a Certificate in Full Stack Development. My core skills include JavaScript, CSS, HTML, 
            Node/React.js as well as an extensive background in teamwork through being part of a patrol unit for the National 
            Ski Patrol. Decision making is another characteristic I have developed as an Outdoor Emergency Care Technician 
            where the environment is fast paced and decisions can be life altering. Unique in my healthcare background, I have 
            come to find a passion in Web Development and Medical Software where I can help people in a different way. 
             My inclination to always be learning something new has played a big part in my achievements, and I intend to keep 
             educating myself throughout my future roles.
